# Identifying Out-of-stock Items at Retail Stores Using Computer Vision
# Computer_Vision_SAP_RIPS2023

The main goal of this project is to design a computer vision algorithm that can efficiently extract information from an image of a retail store shelf containing different items. More specifically, we aim to identify which items are out-of-stock (OOS) and match them to the corresponding price tags.

# Objectives 
- [ ] Detect OOS items on shelves by drawing bounding boxes
- [ ] Detect price tags on shelves by drawing bounding boxes
- [ ] Match the OOS items with price tags
- [ ] Extract information from price tags
